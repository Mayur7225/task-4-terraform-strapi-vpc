# Task-4: Secure Strapi Deployment using Terraform

This project demonstrates designing a secure AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
The application runs in a private subnet and is accessed through a load balancer
in a public subnet.

The EC2 instance uses Docker to run Strapi and outbound internet access is handled
using a NAT Gateway.

The focus of this task is Terraform design, modular structure, and best practices.
